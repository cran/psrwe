Description: High-quality real-world data can be transformed into scientific
    real-world evidence for regulatory and healthcare decision-making
    using proven analytical methods and techniques. For example, propensity
    score (PS) methodology can be applied to select a subset of real-world
    data containing patients that are similar to those in the current clinical
    study in terms of baseline covariates, and to stratify the selected
    patients together with those in the current study into more homogeneous
    strata. Then, statistical methods such as the power prior approach or
    composite likelihood approach can be applied in each stratum to draw
    inference for the parameters of interest. This package provides
    functions that implement the PS-integrated real-world 
    evidence analysis methods such as
